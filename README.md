# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Toxin-Peptide-Prediction
Working on a project to predict peptide toxicity using machine learning, utilizing feature extraction methods such as AAC, DPC, ProtBert, and ESM. Currently, benchmarking results with a Stack Model, achieving 95% accuracy in classifying peptides as toxic or non-toxic. Ongoing enhancements are planned to further improve model accuracy.
